Sibers,None,4.8,"Russia, Novosibirskaya Oblast', Novosibirsk",1998,>100,,"Sibers is in software development business since 1998. And Sibers' mobile team, the newest team is, not surprisingly, its busiest. 2003 was when Sibers commenced its first mobile project; if memory serves correct, it was Java ME and C++ for Nokia’s Symbian “smartphone”. Remember Symbian? No? Well, you’re not alone. Anyways, that was many years ago, and platforms and standards have changed considerably. In 2009, Sibers officially formed its Mobile Development Team, covering iOS (formerly iPhone OS), Android OS and Windows Phone (formerly Windows Mobile) coding. And over the last 5+ years, we’ve launched more than 800 mobile apps for these popular platforms. In-between, we’ve even found time to make a few Bada and BlackBerry applications!","Sibers company offices
